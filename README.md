Description-
The Personal Portfolio Website is a dynamic and interactive platform built using Express.js and Handlebars, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The website features a welcoming home page, an "About Me" section with a brief biography and interactive photo, a "Projects" section displaying my work with engaging flip-box effects, and a "Contact" section with a form for visitors to reach out, alongside links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. The site employs responsive design techniques to ensure a seamless experience across devices, custom styling with Google Fonts, and CSS animations for enhanced user interaction.
